# Distributed-Score-Averaging-Classifier

### Distributed Score Averaging Classifier

Let’s explore a new classification method by using an example involving predicting the outcomes of matches between two countries, T and F. Imagine that each attribute represents a different sport, while values like x1, x2, and x3 indicate the rounds of the games. The labels "T" and "F" represent the points scored by countries T and F, respectively.

#### Understanding the Training Data

Suppose we have the following training sample:

| f1 | f2 | f3 | Label |
|----|----|----|-------|
| x1 | x4 | x7 | T     |

This sample suggests that three matches, each in a different sport (F1, F2, and F3), were played simultaneously, and country T scored a point. However, it's unclear in which specific game the point was scored. To address this, we distribute the point equally across the three games, assigning 1/3 of a point to each of the rounds x1, x4, and x7.

Next, consider the training data, where the notation x1(4T, 6F) means that out of all samples with the feature value f1 equal to x1, 4 were labeled T, and 6 were labeled F. This distribution is crucial for predicting future outcomes.

#### Calculating Points for Each Country

Based on the training data, the points accumulated by countries T and F in each sport are as follows:

- **Country T**:
  - Sport f1, round x1: 4/3 points
  - Sport f2, round x2: 7/3 points
  - Sport f3, round x3: 7/3 points

- **Country F**:
  - Sport f1, round x1: 6/3 points
  - Sport f2, round x2: 3/3 points
  - Sport f3, round x3: 7/3 points

These values are summarized below:

| Points in Sport f3 (x3) | Points in Sport f2 (x2) | Points in Sport f1 (x1) | Country  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------|
| 7/3                     | 7/3                     | 4/3                     | Country T |
| 7/3                     | 3/3                     | 6/3                     | Country F |

#### Predicting Future Outcomes

Now, let's predict the scores for future matches between the two countries in the three sports, using the training data above.

The predicted scores are calculated by summing the points across all sports:

| Predicted Scores for Future Matches |
|-------------------------------------|
| 4/3 + 7/3 + 7/3 = 18/3              | Country T |
| 6/3 + 3/3 + 7/3 = 16/3              | Country F |

#### Converting Scores to Probabilities

Finally, to make these scores probabilistic, we calculate the relative likelihood of each country winning:

| Predicted Probabilities for Future Matches |
|--------------------------------------------|
| (18/3) / (18/3 + 16/3) ≈ 0.53              | Probability T |
| (16/3) / (18/3 + 16/3) ≈ 0.47              | Probability F |

This means there’s approximately a 53% chance that country T will win, and a 47% chance that country F will win, based on the historical data and the distribution of scores across the different sports.
